# React Table with Dropdowns

This is a simple React application that implements a table with interactive dropdowns for data selection. The table allows users to select options from both single and multi-select dropdowns, with dynamic row addition and an editable list in one of the columns. 

## Features
1. **Single Select Dropdown (Column 1):**
   - Allows users to select an option from a static list.
   - Once an item is selected in a row, it cannot be reselected in the next row.
   
2. **Multi Select Dropdown (Column 2):**
   - Users can select multiple options from a predefined list.
   - An option to add new items to the list is provided at the bottom of the dropdown.
   
3. **Add Row Button:**
   - Allows users to add new rows dynamically to the table.
   - New rows include interactive dropdowns in the first two columns.

### Running the App
   Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project locally by executing the following command:

    ```
    npm run dev
  This will start the development server, and you can view the application in your browser at http://localhost:5000.

## Dependencies
- React: Library for building user interfaces.
- React-Select: For creating customizable select dropdowns.
- CSS: Plain CSS used for styling (You can replace with Tailwind CSS or another CSS framework if desired).
  
**Usage**
- You can select options from the dropdowns in the table's first and second columns.
- The "Add Row" button allows adding new rows dynamically.
- In the second column, users can add new items to the list, which will immediately appear as options.
  
**Features to Consider for Enhancement**
- Data Persistence: Integrate local storage or a backend API to save table data for future sessions.
- Validation: Implement validation to ensure data integrity, such as preventing the same option selection across rows.
- Styling Improvements: Enhance UI design with animations or custom styles.
